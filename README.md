JoomShopping Plugin for OBRSS
================================

Development (and support) on this plugin has stopped. Changes were last made in 2013, so I've no idea whether the plugin will work with later versions of the software. The codebase was moved onto Github in May 2017

Allows the Joomla extention ObRSS to create RSS feeds of products within a Joomshopping install.

Feature set is

* Filter by one or more categories
* Filter by one or more manufacturers
* Filter by one or more Labels (e.g. 'New')
* Display short or long description
* Display (or hide) Price, SKU, Manufacturer
* Include a button linking straight to the product
* Include an Add-to-Cart button


Usage is quite simple, and documentation can be viewed on [www.bentasker.co.uk](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/joomla/212-joomshopping-plugin-for-obrss)
